# Adafruit_DAP
port of free-DAP to SAMD21

This is a library that allows you to program atmel cortex M chips that support programming via DAP from an arduino-compatible samd21 board.

Once the code is uploaded there are no computers required!!!!!

This is mostly a re-mix of Alex Taradovs excellent Free-DAP code - we just put both halves into one library and wrapped it up in Arduino compatibility
